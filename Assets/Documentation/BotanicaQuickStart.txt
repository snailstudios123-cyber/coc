BOTANICA SYSTEM - QUICK START
==============================

I've created the Botanica encounter and boss reward system for you!

WHAT IT DOES:
-------------

After player falls into UndergroundRuins:
1. Botanica (goddess) appears and speaks
2. Player explores dungeon
3. Player defeats boss in BossRoom
4. Botanica returns and gives rewards (+1 heart, full heal)
5. Player teleports back to village

HOW TO SET IT UP:
-----------------

STEP 1: Create Dialogue (1 click)
   Unity Menu: Tools → Story Progression → 1. Create Botanica Dialogue
   
   ✓ Creates dialogue for Botanica's encounters

STEP 2: Manual Setup (follow guide)
   Open: Assets/Documentation/BotanicaManualSetup.txt
   
   ✓ Step-by-step instructions to add Botanica to scenes
   ✓ How to create BossRoom
   ✓ How to set up rewards

THE MANUAL WAY:
---------------

The automated tools had issues, so I've created a complete manual setup guide instead.

Why manual? 
- More reliable
- Easier to understand
- You can customize as you go
- No scene corruption risks

The manual guide is VERY detailed with screenshots in words and checklists!
