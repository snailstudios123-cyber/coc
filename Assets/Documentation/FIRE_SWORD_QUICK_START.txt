🔥⚔️ FIRE SWORD SPELL - QUICK START ⚔️🔥
========================================

SUPER EASY 3-STEP SETUP:
========================

1. Tools → 🔥 Setup Fire Sword Spell
   (Everything is done automatically!)

2. Open Assets/Animation/ folder and add frames:
   • FireSwordCharge.anim → Add your charging sprite frames
   • FireSwordRapidStrike.anim → Add your strike sprite frames (keep SHORT!)

3. DONE! Hold X to charge, release to strike!


CONTROLS:
=========
HOLD X = Charge up (drains mana)
RELEASE X = Unleash rapid fire strikes!


STATS:
======
• 15 damage per strike
• Up to 5 rapid strikes (75 total damage!)
• 0.1 seconds between each strike
• Charges for up to 3 seconds
• Costs 0.15 mana per second while charging


CHARGE TIMES:
=============
0.2s charge = 1 strike  (15 damage)
0.6s charge = 2 strikes (30 damage)
1.5s charge = 3 strikes (45 damage)
2.4s charge = 4 strikes (60 damage)
3.0s charge = 5 strikes (75 damage!) 🔥


CUSTOMIZE:
==========
Select your Player and find the FireSwordSpell component:
• Damage Per Strike - how much each hit does
• Time Between Strikes - how fast the strikes happen (lower = faster!)
• Max Charge Time - max time to charge
• Mana Per Second - how much mana charging costs
• Attack Area - how big the hit box is


TROUBLESHOOTING:
================
Q: Nothing happens when I hold X?
A: Make sure you have enough mana! Charging drains mana continuously.

Q: Can I change the key?
A: Open FireSwordSpell.cs and change KeyCode.X to your preferred key.

Q: Damage too high/low?
A: Adjust "Damage Per Strike" in the component (default: 15)

Q: Want faster strikes?
A: Lower "Time Between Strikes" (default: 0.1, try 0.05 for super fast!)


ENJOY YOUR FIRE SWORD! 🔥⚔️
