🔥⚔️ FIRE SWORD SPELL - SETUP GUIDE ⚔️🔥
=========================================

OVERVIEW:
---------
This spell charges while holding X, draining mana. When you release X, 
it unleashes rapid fire sword strikes that deal massive damage!

The longer you charge (up to 3 seconds), the more strikes you get (max 5).


⚡ AUTOMATIC SETUP (RECOMMENDED):
==================================

1. Go to: Tools → 🔥 Setup Fire Sword Spell

2. Click it and DONE! Everything is set up automatically:
   ✓ FireSwordSpell component added
   ✓ Animation clips created (FireSwordCharge.anim & FireSwordRapidStrike.anim)
   ✓ Animator parameters added
   ✓ Animator states and transitions created
   ✓ Connected to PlayerController
   ✓ All settings configured

3. Add your sprite frames to the animations:
   • Assets/Animation/FireSwordCharge.anim (charging animation - can loop)
   • Assets/Animation/FireSwordRapidStrike.anim (single strike - keep SHORT!)

THAT'S IT! Press HOLD X to charge, RELEASE X to strike!


📋 MANUAL SETUP (if you prefer):
=================================

1. ADD COMPONENT TO PLAYER
   ------------------------
   • Select your Player GameObject
   • Add Component → Scripts → Fire Sword Spell
   • The script will automatically find PlayerController, Animator, and PlayerStateList


2. CONFIGURE FIRE SWORD SETTINGS
   ------------------------------
   In the FireSwordSpell component:
   
   ✓ Mana Per Second: 0.15 (how fast mana drains while charging)
   ✓ Max Charge Time: 3 (maximum charge time in seconds)
   ✓ Strike Count: 5 (max number of rapid strikes)
   ✓ Time Between Strikes: 0.1 (speed of rapid strikes - lower = faster!)
   ✓ Strike Range: 2 (not used with box attack)
   ✓ Damage Per Strike: 15 (damage for each hit - customize this!)
   
   Attack Area:
   ✓ Attack Point: Drag your existing attack point transform here
   ✓ Attack Area: Set to (2, 1.5) or adjust to match your sword range
   ✓ Enemy Layer: Select "Attackable" layer
   
   Visual Effects (optional):
   ✓ Fire Slash Effect: Drag your slash effect prefab here
   ✓ Charge Effect: Drag a charge/glow effect prefab here (optional)


3. SETUP PLAYER CONTROLLER
   ------------------------
   • Select your Player GameObject
   • In PlayerController component, scroll to "Fire Sword Spell" section
   • Drag the FireSwordSpell component to the "Fire Sword Spell" slot


4. CREATE ANIMATION CLIPS
   -----------------------
   A. Create "FireSwordCharge" animation:
      • In Project: Right-click Animation folder → Create → Animation
      • Name it: "FireSwordCharge"
      • This will play while holding X and charging
      • ADD YOUR FIRE SWORD CHARGING FRAMES HERE

   B. Create "FireSwordRapidStrike" animation:
      • In Project: Right-click Animation folder → Create → Animation
      • Name it: "FireSwordRapidStrike"
      • This is a single strike animation that plays rapidly
      • ADD YOUR FIRE SWORD STRIKE FRAMES HERE
      • Keep it SHORT (0.1-0.2 seconds) for rapid attacks!


5. SETUP ANIMATOR CONTROLLER
   --------------------------
   • Open your Player animator controller (Assets/Animation/Player.controller)
   
   A. Add Parameters:
      • Add Bool: "ChargingFireSword"
      • Add Trigger: "FireSwordStrike"
   
   B. Add States:
      • Create state: "Fire Sword Charge" → assign FireSwordCharge animation
      • Create state: "Fire Sword Strike" → assign FireSwordRapidStrike animation
   
   C. Add Transitions:
      • From "Any State" → "Fire Sword Charge"
        Condition: ChargingFireSword == true
        Exit Time: unchecked
        Transition Duration: 0
      
      • From "Fire Sword Charge" → "Idle" (or appropriate state)
        Condition: ChargingFireSword == false
        Exit Time: unchecked
        Transition Duration: 0.1
      
      • From "Any State" → "Fire Sword Strike"
        Condition: FireSwordStrike trigger
        Exit Time: unchecked
        Transition Duration: 0
      
      • From "Fire Sword Strike" → "Idle" (or appropriate state)
        Has Exit Time: checked
        Exit Time: 1.0
        Transition Duration: 0.1


HOW IT WORKS:
=============

1. HOLD X KEY:
   • Starts charging (plays charge animation)
   • Drains mana continuously
   • Player cannot move while charging
   • Charge up to 3 seconds max

2. RELEASE X KEY:
   • Performs rapid fire sword strikes
   • Number of strikes depends on charge time:
     - 0.2s charge = 1 strike
     - 0.6s charge = 2 strikes
     - 1.5s charge = 3 strikes
     - 2.4s charge = 4 strikes
     - 3.0s charge = 5 strikes (max)
   
   • Each strike:
     ✓ Hits all enemies in attack area
     ✓ Deals 15 damage per hit
     ✓ Spawns fire slash effect
     ✓ Gives back 0.05 mana per enemy hit
     ✓ Happens every 0.1 seconds

3. AUTO-CANCEL:
   • If you run out of mana while charging, it cancels
   • If you charge for less than 0.2 seconds, nothing happens


TIPS:
=====
• Adjust "damagePerStrike" for balance (15 damage × 5 strikes = 75 total!)
• Lower "timeBetweenStrikes" (e.g., 0.05) for even faster attacks
• Increase "manaPerSecond" to make it cost more mana to charge
• Adjust "attackArea" size to match your sword animation reach


TROUBLESHOOTING:
================

Q: Nothing happens when I hold X?
A: • Make sure FireSwordSpell component is on Player
   • Check that you have enough mana
   • Verify Attack Point is assigned

Q: Animation doesn't play?
A: • Check animator parameters are created correctly
   • Make sure animation clips are assigned to states
   • Verify transitions are set up from "Any State"

Q: Strikes don't hit enemies?
A: • Check "Enemy Layer" is set to "Attackable"
   • Adjust "Attack Area" size
   • Verify Attack Point position in scene

Q: Want to change the key from X?
A: • Open FireSwordSpell.cs
   • Find: Input.GetKey(KeyCode.X)
   • Change to your preferred key


ENJOY YOUR FIRE SWORD SPELL! 🔥⚔️
